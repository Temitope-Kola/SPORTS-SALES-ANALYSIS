* The Total Order Quantity: 1,341,925 indicates a strong demand for the company's products. A high number of orders means the business is reaching a broad customer base.

* The Total Revenue: $101,626,604.00, Crossing the $100M mark in revenue shows significant market presence and sales success. This suggests that the company has a solid pricing strategy and effective sales channels.
 
* The Total Profits: $44,525,164.00, A strong profit margin indicates efficient cost management and healthy business operations. The company is not just generating revenue but also ensuring good profitability.

## General Insight On All Key Performing Indicators:
The business is performing well with a high volume of orders, strong revenue, and impressive profits. However, to sustain and grow profits, the company should focus on expanding into underperforming markets, optimizing pricing strategies, and increasing the popularity of lower-selling products. 

## Revenue Distribution By Region

Australia ($32.3M) and United States ($30.5M) generate the highest revenue.
Canada ($7.9M) has the lowest revenue among the listed countries.

* Recommendations:
Expand marketing and distribution efforts in Canada, France, and Germany to increase revenue.
Strengthen relationships with retailers in high-performing countries (Australia & U.S.) to maintain growth.
* Conclusion:
The business is thriving in Australia and the U.S., but there is untapped potential in other countries that should be explored, simply put,other countries can do better.
